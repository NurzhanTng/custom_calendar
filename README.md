My project is a **calendar** component that can be used anywhere. The project was originally created using [create_react_app](https://create-react-app.dev). Link to [source](https://youtu.be/B8F9_IVgipw)

This is what my component looks like. Here you can see 3 component states: in the days, months, years tab. To change the tab, you need to switch to the text between the arrows on top. The date above the calendar represents the selected date

The project is mainly written on [React](https://reactjs.org/) technology. In particular, I came across the following concepts:

- **React hooks:**
  - useState
  - useMemo
  - useCalender (my custom hook)
- **Custom Utilite to work with JavaScript Date**
- **Typescript:**
  - Generic Types
  - Type for component properties
- **Dynamically added components and classes for components**
